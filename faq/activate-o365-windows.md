How to Activate Microsoft Office 365 on Windows Computers
================================================

If you are using a Windows computer on campus, including lab computers and classroom podium computers, you may be asked to activate Microsoft Office 365. Trying to sign in with your UTD email and password usually doesn't work.

If you encounter this scenario, follow these steps to activate.

Before starting, close any open Microsoft Office applications.
