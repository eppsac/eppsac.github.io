EPPS Computer Lab Policies
==========================

The School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences Computer Labs are managed by the Economic, Political and Policy Sciences Academic Computing (EPPS AC) office, which has the responsibility to ensure the lab’s secure and smooth operation.

The labs are monitored with 24/7 video surveillance as well as access logging via Comet Card reader at the entrance.

No food, drinks, or tobacco products are allowed in the Labs. Open containers should be stored away or disposed of before entering the Labs.

Children are not allowed in the Labs, and you will be asked to leave if you are disturbing other users.

Users are responsible for their own data and work files. The lab management has no responsibility to back up or restore users’ files.

Neither the school nor the university is responsible for personal items left in the Labs. You may check with the EPPS Dean's Office (GR 3.104) or the UTD Police Department to see if a lost item has been turned in.

Users are not allowed to install software or games of their own except under the supervision of teaching faculty members for instructional purposes.

One user may occupy one machine at one time. Users found occupying multiple machines will be logged out without warning and unsaved data will be lost.

Users should refrain from fixing, tampering or reinstalling the equipment including the printer, computers and projectors in the Labs. Hardware problems or suspected software issues should be reported to the EPPS-AC.

No equipment may leave the Labs under any circumstances. TAs, RAs, and faculty are not authorized to permit equipment to leave the Labs.
