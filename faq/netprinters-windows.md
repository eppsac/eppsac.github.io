How To Setup The Ricoh Network Printers on Windows
=================================================

There are several Ricoh network printers which EPPS faculty, staff, lecturers, and teaching assistants (who are teaching a course) may use. To use them, you must have a valid copy code. To install them on your computer, follow this guide.

## Identify Printer

Identify which printer you want to install. Here is a list of the available printers:

**Note:** Only copy/paste the IP address (numbers) in **bold**

*   **10.152.42.25** (in [GR 3.706](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1772#!m/550865))
*   **10.152.40.29** (in [GR 2.818](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1772#!m/550792) on the right)
*   **10.152.40.30** (in [GR 2.818](https://map.concept3d.com/?id=1772#!m/550792) on the left)

## Download the Drivers

Next, download the driver for your operating system from Ricoh:

[IM 7000/IM 8000/IM 9000 Downloads - Ricoh Global](http://support.ricoh.com/bb/html/dr_ut_e/re1/model/im7000/im7000.htm)

On **Windows**, you can choose the **PCL6** driver:

Double-click on the **.exe** file (it should start with ‘**z**‘ with some numbers and letters after it). When prompted, select **Yes** to allow it to make changes to your computer. Then in the installation window, click **Agree and Go to Next**:
